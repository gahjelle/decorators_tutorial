# Introduction to Decorators Tutorial

This repository contains material for the **Introduction to Decorators - Power Up Your Python Code** tutorials that I've given.

I've had the pleasure of teaching about decorators at [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/) several times. Each occasion has its own page with all the materials. The sessions have also been filmed and are available on YouTube:

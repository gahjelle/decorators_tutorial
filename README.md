# Introduction to Decorators Tutorial

This repository contains material for the **Introduction to Decorators - Power Up Your Python Code** tutorials that I've given.

I've had the pleasure of teaching about decorators at [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/) twice. Each occasion has it's own page with all the materials. Both sessions have also been filmed and are available on YouTube:

- **PyCon 2021 Online** [ [Materials](2021/) - [Video](https://youtu.be/VWZAh1QrqRE) ]
- **PyCon 2020 Online** [ [Materials](2020/) - [Video](https://youtu.be/T8CQwGIsrx4) ]
